You need to install your Firebase configuration file to use Firebase services in your Android app. Please follow these steps:

1. Download the `google-services.json` file from your Firebase project settings.
2. Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app/` directory of your Flutter project.
3. Ensure that your `build.gradle` files are configured to use the Google services plugin.
4. Sync your project with Gradle files to apply the changes.

Make sure to rebuild your project after adding the configuration file to ensure that Firebase services are properly integrated.
